# react-research

Currently this is a React sandbox for texting our new Utility class CSS approach vs our Styled Components approach.
Webpack is setup so it can consume the styled-components from CapUI, and also consume the SCSS from CapUI.

## Start the development environment
npm run dev

The repo has two pages available at localhost:8080/newCssApproach.html and localhost:8080/oldStyledComponentsApproach
